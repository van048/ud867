Here's the build script specifically for the Android app. Note that it first
applies the Android plugin, which it fetched from jcenter. All configuration
of the Android plugin happens in the `android` configuration block. All that's
absolutely required are the first two lines defining the SDK version and the
build tools version. The `defaultConfig` block configures attributes of the
Android Manifest. We'll talk about the `buildTypes` block momentarily.

library. We'll also be talking about this block more soon.
